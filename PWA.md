# 📱 PWA (Progressive Web App) Setup

Your Digital Clock app now has full PWA support! Here's what that means and how to use it.

## ✨ What is PWA?

A Progressive Web App is a web application that provides a native app-like experience:
- **Installable**: Install directly on your device's home screen
- **Offline-capable**: Works even without internet connection
- **App-like**: Fullscreen display, no browser UI
- **Fast**: Instant loading with service worker caching
- **Responsive**: Works on all devices and screen sizes

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. **Install the App**

#### On Android:
1. Open the clock app in your browser
2. Tap the **Install** button (appears at bottom)
3. Or: Tap menu → "Install app"
4. The app will appear on your home screen

#### On iPhone/iPad (iOS 15+):
1. Open the clock app in Safari
2. Tap **Share** button
3. Scroll and tap **Add to Home Screen**
4. Tap **Add**
5. The app will appear on your home screen

#### On Desktop/Mac:
1. Open the clock app in Chrome/Edge
2. Click the **Install** icon (top-right address bar) or the prompt that appears
3. Tap **Install**
4. The app will open in its own window

#### On Chromebook:
1. Open the clock app
2. Click the menu (⋮) in the top-right
3. Select **Install app**
4. Confirm

### 2. **Use the Installed App**

Once installed:
- App runs in fullscreen (no browser UI)
- Quick access from home screen
- Runs offline after first load
- All settings are preserved
- Updates automatically

## 🔌 Offline Support

The app works completely offline after the first load:

### What Works Offline?
- ✅ Clock display
- ✅ All settings and customizations
- ✅ Settings persistence (localStorage)
- ✅ Animations and interactions
- ✅ Font rendering

### How It Works?
1. Service Worker caches essential files
2. On next visit, cached files are used first
3. If online, app fetches latest version
4. Automatic updates apply in background

## 🔄 Updates

The app automatically checks for updates:
- Updates happen in the background
- You'll see a notification when available
- Settings are preserved during updates
- No manual intervention needed

## 📋 PWA Files

### New Files Added:
- `public/manifest.json` - App manifest (metadata, icons, display info)
- `public/sw.js` - Service Worker (offline caching, background updates)
- `src/hooks/usePWA.ts` - PWA lifecycle management
- `src/components/PWAPrompt.tsx` - Install prompt UI

### Updated Files:
- `index.html` - Added PWA meta tags and service worker registration

## 🛠️ Customization

### Change App Appearance

Edit `public/manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "Your Custom Name",
  "short_name": "Short Name",
  "description": "Your custom description",
  "theme_color": "#000000",
  "background_color": "#000000"
}
```

### Add Custom Icons

Place your icons in `public/`:
- `clock-192.png` (192x192px)
- `clock-512.png` (512x512px)
- `clock-192-maskable.png` (Maskable icon)
- `clock-512-maskable.png` (Maskable icon)

Icons should be PNG format with transparent background.

### Change Caching Strategy

Edit `public/sw.js` to modify cache behavior:

```javascript
// Change cache version
const CACHE_NAME = 'digital-clock-v2'

// Modify caching strategy (network-first, cache-first, stale-while-revalidate)
```

## 📱 Testing

### Test on Desktop:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab
3. Check "Offline" to simulate offline mode
4. Refresh page - should still work

### Test on Android:
1. Plug in Android phone via USB
2. Chrome on PC → chrome://inspect
3. Select device
4. DevTools opens on phone
5. Same offline testing as above

### Test on iOS:
1. Open Settings → Safari
2. Enable "Developer" settings (if available)
3. Use Safari Web Inspector
